# Base-Camp-Job-Search
This project is an independent based project. We have to use a framework of our choice and make a job postion page that allows employers to post jobs online and people who are looking for jobs can view the details of that job and comment on it as well.
# What the application does:

  This application is a job posting app with a base camp theme. It has two sides the admin/employer and the user/employee.
  It is made using python's framework, Django, and HTML, CSS, SQLite Database, and Bootstrap.

# Admin/Employer:


  This side of the application is souly for the admin to view created job postings, make/delete new job posting, and make/delete new comments. Only the admin side can delete and create. It gets data out from the database and displays it through django templates.


  # User/Employee:

  This side of the application is souly for the user side. The user can only see the job postings and the pre-exsiting comments. They can also go view the 2019 Base Camp students page.
  This page has links to each student's portfolios.
